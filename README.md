## Overview
KEC Lab Manual Creator is a web application designed to help students of Krishna Engineering College (KEC) easily generate professional lab manual cover pages. The project was inspired by the challenges faced by students who do not have access to laptops or consistent software environments, resulting in inconsistent and time-consuming manual cover creation. This tool streamlines the process, ensuring uniformity and accessibility for all students, regardless of their device or operating system.

## Motivation
Many students struggle to create custom front pages for their lab manuals due to:
- Lack of access to laptops or desktop computers.
- Differences in operating systems and available software, leading to inconsistent designs.
- Time-consuming manual formatting and editing.

KEC Lab Manual Creator solves these problems by providing a simple, device-independent web interface that generates standardized, attractive lab manual covers in seconds.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
- **Step-by-Step Form:** Guides users through entering subject, student, and faculty details.
- **Live Validation:** Ensures all inputs are correct before generating the cover.
- **Preview Mode:** Allows users to review the generated cover before downloading.
- **PDF Download:** Generates a high-quality PDF of the cover page for easy printing or sharing.
- **Toast Notifications & Loading Animations:** Provides feedback and improves user experience.
- **Modern UI & Animations:** Uses GSAP animations, smooth transitions, and a minimal aesthetic for a professional look.
- **Dark Mode & Accessibility:** Theme support (light/dark) and accessible UI controls.
- **Animated Menu & Loading Screen:** Pull-down menu and a lightweight loading screen replace the old PWA workflows.

## How It Works
1. **Fill the Form:** Enter all required details (subject, student, faculty, etc.).
2. **Preview:** Review the generated cover page for accuracy.
3. **Download:** Save the cover as a PDF, ready to print or submit.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Core web technologies for structure, styling, and interactivity.
- **GSAP:** For polished animations and transitions.
- **html2canvas & jsPDF:** For rendering the cover and generating the PDF.
- **Google Fonts (Bebas Neue, Inter):** Typography used across the app.

## Note on PWA

## Changelog (Short)
- Updated UI anc removed PWA and offline workflows.
- Added dark mode, animated menu (drag-to-open), and a minimal loading screen with GSAP animations.
- Improved accessibility, form validation, and consistent PDF output.

## Accessibility
- No installation required — works in any modern browser.
- Works on any device (including smartphones and tablets).
- No dependencies on OS or external software.
